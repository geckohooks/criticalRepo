# critical_repo
This is the Critical Repository (Repo) for my research on *Point Clouds, Photogrammetry and Volumetric Regimes*. As Carol Grey and Julian Malins outline: 
>There are two distinct phases in developing an understanding of your proposed research area through a Contextual Review:
>1. Initial surveys, to establish the proposal’s rationale and viability, to provide some background information, and to help focus the proposal. From these searches a set of relevant references/sources can be compiled into a bibliography and/or a ‘store’ of non-textual source material.
>2. The use of these references/sources to develop a critical review of your research context, leading to the identificaton of your own particular research question and the development of a convincing argument. (2004, pp.53-54)

This repo will contain a file of **notes and quotes** for each of the bibliographic sources in my initial survey, as well as **documentation of non-text sources**, including description and analysis of these. 

Notes cover a wide variety of functions, including: explaining quotes, considering possible relevance to my research topic, signposting links with other practitioners or theorists, or even notes-to-self about how/where material could get used, other research required to understand issues better, potential examples, designs, artworks, software etc. that illustrate/problematise the source in question.

## Literature Reviews
A literature review is normally a chapter within a master's or PhD thesis that reviews all relevant literature on a given topic. That is, it’s only about mapping and analysing theory.

## Contextual Reviews
Similarly, a contextual review is also chapter within a master's or PhD thesis, but rather than simply look at textual sources (i.e. literature) it includes discussion of relevant artworks, games, apps, designs and other cultural forms. 

## Contextual Repository
The contextual repo is a (github) repository containing notes and quotes about all the source materials you might use to inform your final thesis/project.

### Step 1: Make a list of sources
This will include: books, book chapters, journal articles and so on. But it can also include other cultural artefacts like artworks, designs, technologies etc.
Whatever sources you use, should be referenced using the Harvard Style:

Hemment, D. (2006) ‘Locative Arts,’ *Leonardo,* Vol. 39, No. 4, pp. 348–355.
Kojima, H. (2019) *Death Stranding.* Kojima Productions.
McCall, J. (2020) ‘The Historical Problem Space Framework: Games as a Historical Medium,’ *Game Studies,* Vol.  20, No. 3. [Available online at http://gamestudies.org/2003/articles/mccall].

### Step 2: Annotate each source
- Start with a paragraph or two summarizing the source: what it says, why its useful, whether it agrees or disagrees with others, how it adds to the discourse/practice.
- Take quotes from text sources (these should be Harvard Referenced)
- Write notes about them
- Describe and analyse non-text sources

Notes may: 
- explain quotes, 
- analyse sources/quotes, 
- discuss the relevance to your research interest, 
- consider how you might use the source, 
- compare/contract with other texts, practices and perspectives, 
- offer potential examples
- something else
