# Gray, Jonathan and Marres, Noortje (2018) “The data city as public experiment.” In, *London Ideas,* No. 1, 13.07.2018, p. 11-15

This paper is about the role of data in understanding the city. Perhaps the key message is: 'Data technologies do more than merely monitor urban life. They may also shape it, inviting users to take on the role of participants and play an active role in defining and taking action.' (Gray & Noortje 2018, p.13) Why are we looking at a paper that discusses data and the city, in a session on possible methods? Because ‘data’ (whether digital or not) is the raw material of research. Ways of collecting data, filtering it, analysing it etc. are central to research. Digital data is even more central to digital research! The methodological concerns in this paper are relevant to us; but so too are the issues they discuss.

>Cities have long been imagined as “machines for living,” and today's data technologies carry the promise of making them more “intelligent” … How might data, and data culture, play a role in reshaping city life, for whom, and to what end? (Gray & Noortje 2018, p.11)

>The life of a city may be understood from accounts and artefacts such as maps, music, fiction, films, plans, photographs, paintings, newspapers, conversations, reports, records, statues and street furniture. (Gray & Noortje 2018, p.11)

>Such items reflect certain aspects of urban life and leave others out: the schematic abstraction of tube maps highlights sequences of stops for transport users; monuments relate public spaces to historical events; photographs portray scenes in accordance with certain political or aesthetic visions. The significance of such things depends on who uses them and how. (Gray & Noortje 2018, p.11)

Are there artefacts that might help you understand your research? What are they? 
What do they reveal, and what do they leave out?

Gray & Noortje point out that cities collect data for many purposes--births, deaths, marriages, property ownership, crimes etc.--and have done for a long time. Moreover, they say, ‘Digital technologies multiply the sites where data is made, where it is made sense of and made actionable.’ (Gray & Noortje 2018, p.11)

Data from IoT devices, ‘often record activities and are not always tied to individuals; they are increasingly used to monitor, model, estimate, allocate, optimise, nudge, manage and display urban activities.’ (Gray & Noortje 2018, p.11)

Are there data streams and sources that might usefully inform your research? What are they? What do they reveal, and what do they leave out?

> today's data technologies provide apparently comprehensive insights into the particulars of urban living (Gray & Noortje 2018, p.12)

Is it true that ‘the visions and aesthetics associated with \[creating and using data\] can be sweeping, panoramic, sometimes even sublime.’? (12) What kind of problems might this lead to?

>...insofar as digital technologies make it possible to gather data pertaining to activities rather than named persons, they may have the potential to shift the focus from surveillance of individuals to creating new different kinds of data collectives. (Gray & Noortje 2018, p.12)

Presumably, when they use the term ‘data collectives’ they’re referring to various communities, shared interests or experiences, services etc. that particular data measure? For example, data about rubbish collection bring together the interests and experiences of everyone who live in a given area, whereas data about car parking mainly (but not entirely) affects car owners. That said, on a cursory google check, the term is also used to refer to users of data. For example, www.data-collective.org.uk defines the term: ‘The Data Collective is a community of individuals who work in the UK social sector, and use or want to use data.’ But in the context of the above quote, the gist is about the shift from surveilling individuals to being able to track the experiences of groups.

> Social media platforms such as Facebook amass data through what has been called the “double logic” of the platform – centralising data collection while distributing platform features through which data is collected. The self-declared contribution of such platforms is to enable us to live otherwise (to make new friends, visit new places); but they equally affect existing ways of doing, requiring new policies and public oversight. (Gray & Noortje 2018, p.12)

In what ways does this ‘double logic’ matter? How does it make a difference?

Gray & Noortje argue that while cities are capable of limiting multinationals (such as Uber) when they overstep civic interests, it’s much more difficult to develop ‘alternative, public-minded frameworks and methodologies for defning, designing and intervening in data.’

Envisioning the 'city as a “living laboratory” \[...\] frames our living environments and lives as open to experimentation and modification. But the role of a city dweller is very different from that of a laboratory subject: we make sense of our own lives and actively participate in defining our world in ways beyond the scope of analysts.' (Gray & Noortje 2018, p.13)

What's important about this? For a start, I don't always *want* to modify and experiment with my environment! There's labour involved in doing this, and a political issue around the difficulty in maintining control over ones own affairs, in a dataworld that balloons outwards, often without our knowledge. If our world is determined more and more by digital infrastructures and processes, it becomes harder to actively participate in defining that world.

> Urban data does not just represent city life, it also renders it intelligible \[...\] Data infrastructures should be understood not just optically (as lenses or microscopes), but as scripting or framing devices, which actively format the activities they purport to measure. (Gray & Noortje 2018, p.13)

> What then might urban digital data do for city dwellers? What counts and who decides? Who and what do data infrastructures draw together? What capacities do they confer, and to what end? Could data and data technology enable different forms of participation in the city? (Gray & Noortje 2018, p.13)

I love this quote! It could be rephrased/repurposed for all sorts of projects:  'What then might digital data do for \[this project\]? What counts and who decides? Who and what do data infrastructures draw together? What capacities do they confer, and to what end? Could data and data technology enable different forms of participation in \[this project\]?' 

> Many big data experiments treat parameters and questions as fixed in advance. But data may also involve non-experts in research: considering what is asked, which problems are deemed important, and which categories guide interpretation. Surveys and opinion polls solicit citizens to take positions on the issues of the day through interviews, focus groups or the ballot box. Data technologies enable other means to elicit, articulate and evaluate public concerns at different scales.(Gray & Noortje 2018, p.13)

Again, really great methodological insights for any research project. Why does it matter that, 'Many big data experiments treat parameters and questions as fixed in advance.'? Because it's easy to confirm biases through questions. Very often, research can re-inforce existing assumptions by asking the wrong thing. Especially with big data, parameters become proxies that seem to represent an issue well (and fully) but we forget that our data points may miss out much nuance, and even become misleading in their one dimensional portrayal of a situation. 

> Offcial data can be re-used to address different kinds of questions and concerns from those for which it was intended. In New York, data that was originally gathered to monitor crime has been repurposed by journalists and activists to highlight problematic and discriminatory policing practices.
