Responding to McLuhanite thinking, Raymond Williams argued against what subsequently became known as Technological Determinism by suggesting that “Any idea that a medium can be reduced to a technology, or that the technological element which is admitted to be a part of any media process should be central to its study, [should be] strongly resisted.”  (Lister et al 2009, p.78)

Williams was one of the founding figures of British media and cultural studies. His rich [discussion] about cultural production and society provided some of the master templates for what has become mainstream media studies. (Lister et al 2009, p.78)

Wherever we consider […] new media as subject to control and direction by human institutions, skill, creativity and intention, we are building upon such a Williamsite emphasis. (Lister et al 2009, p.78)

Although McLuhan was dismissed roundly by Williams and much of mainstream media theory, he found ‘highly  influential  followers.  Many  of  his ideas have been taken up and developed by a whole range of theorists with an interest in new media: Baudrillard, Virilio, Poster, Kroker, De Kerckhove. (Lister et al 2009, p.78)

Like McLuhan, Kittler’s approach is deeply materialist in orientation and, above all, emphasizes the role of media technologies in structuring ‘human affairs’. But, at the same time, Kittler breaks from McLuhan in important ways. Not least, he proposes the impossibility of understanding media as technologies, for technologies are said to create the conditions under which understanding, or interpretive activity more generally, may take place, rather than vice versa. (Gane and Hansen-Magnusson 2006, p.315)

Kittler’s approach also breaks with other well-known media theorists such as Baudrillard or Lyotard, for it pays little attention to either the shifting logic of simulacral forms or to the forces of the capitalist market. Instead, Kittler focuses overwhelmingly on the hardware of media technologies, and on the conditions and possibilities to which they give rise. (Gane and Hansen-Magnusson 2006, p.315)

Kittler proposes that any medium or channel of communication is a material technology, and thus cannot be understood in an interpretive sense. For example: how is it possible to understand a message once it is coded into a signal? What could a pulse of electricity or a string of binary digits possibly mean? In the light of such questions, Kittler takes McLuhan’s approach to be misguided, for while it might be possible to understand the effects media introduce into social relations, the idea of understanding media in themselves (as technologies) is out of the question. This is because meaning, for Kittler (1986: 166), is little more than an ‘anthropocentric illusion’ and, if anything, is not intrinsic or prior to technology but rather made possible and in turn structured by its development (as both Shannon and Weaver [1949] suggest): ‘the dominant information technologies of the day control all understanding and its illusions’ (Kittler, 1999: xl). Given this, Kittler seeks not to understand media but rather to document their emergence so as to make visible the structures of communication that technology both introduces and makes possible (what David Wellberry calls a ‘post-hermeneutic’ approach [1990: vii–xvi]). (Gane and Hansen-Magnusson 2006, pp.315-316)

What remains of people is what media can store and communicate. What counts are not the messages or the content with which they equip so-called souls for the duration of a technological era, but rather (and in strict accordance with McLuhan) their circuits, the very schematism of perceptibility. (Kittler 1999, pp.xl–xli) 

Kittler and McLuhan here reach a basic agreement: media theory, or what Kittler calls media science (Medienwissenschaft), is not to centre on either the way communications technologies are used, or the content of the messages that pass through them, but rather on the basic material structures of the technologies themselves and the changes they introduce into culture. This marks two important departures from Shannon’s theory of information, for first, Kittler pays detailed attention to the physical components of communication (rather than assigning them a mathematical function), and, second, he analyses communication systems not simply in terms of their ability to process and transmit data but also in their capacity for storage. And with this emphasis on storage or memory, information is treated less as probability function (as it was for Shannon and Weaver) than as a material property (which in many cases is no longer distinct from the material components that hold or transmit it). (Gane and Hansen-Magnusson 2006, pp.316)
