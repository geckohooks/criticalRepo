Pearce, Thomas (2015) "Orchestrating the edge: Towards a noisy point cloud onto-epistemology". In, *Design Ecologies*, Volume 4, Numbers 1-2, 1 December 2015, pp. 142-170(29) https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/intellect/des/2015/00000004/F0020001/art00007

This article in Design Ecologies explores the role of noise within point clouds - specifically 'ghost points' - as a way to critique the idea of 3D visualisation and Lidar scanning's 'accuracy and veracity'.

>The 3D scanner, accurately and impartially registering the scene, is treated as the ultimate facilitator of objective knowledge. This imagination of the scanner as a new camera obscura is, I would argue, characteristic of an understanding of knowledge rooted in the Enlightenment that takes ‘observation to be the benign facilitator of discovery, a transparent lens passively gazing at the world’ (Barad 2007: 97) (Pearce 2015, p.145)

The state of the art status of lidar (light detection and ranging), lasers, 3D scanning etc. affords these processes with the kind of 'truth status' that photography once held. Today, the ability of photography to deceive is well known, and the science of detecting the veracity of digital imagery is fast growing. Cf. Hany Farid (2019) Photo Forensics, MIT Press. Funny how it only takes a new technology to pull the wool over our eyes again!

>The assumption of ‘forensic accuracy’ surrounding 3D scanning lies tacit even within critical artistic and political discourses that have recently embraced the technology. Eyal Weizman’s research project ‘Forensic Architecture’, for example, uses the technology to document sites of violence and addresses them as novel types of evidence in the framework of international humanitarian law. (Pearce 2015, p.145)

>[Weisman argues that their 3D prints] are ‘not a representation but a documentation’ (Weizman and Di Carlo 2012: 33)(Pearce 2015, p.145)

It would be great to triangulate between these 3 texts - Pearce, Weisman and Farid.

> Mini-Me does not represent but creates the discrete biometric subject of the ‘Maxi-Me’, a subject that hence is observable and controllable, or, as Foucault would put it, ‘docile’.
