Hayles, N. Katharine (1999) "Virtual Bodies and Flickering Signifiers". In *How We Became Post Human - Virtual Bodies in Cybernetics, Literature and Informatics*. pp.25-49.

In a literal sense, technologies of inscription are media when they are perceived as mediating, inserting themselves into the chain of textual production. (Hayles 1999,p.26)

Kittler identifies the innovative characteristics of the typewriter, originally designed for the blind, not with speed but rather with "spatially designated and discrete signs," along with a corresponding shift from the word as flowing image to the word "as a geometrical figure created by the spatial arrangements of the letter keys" (here Kittler quotes Richard Herbertz).(Hayles 1999,p.26)

Typewriter keys are directly proportionate to the script they produce. One keystroke yields one letter, and striking the key harder produces a darker letter. The system lends itself to a signification model that links signifier to signified in direct correspondence, for there is a one-to-one relation between the key and the letter it produces. Moreover, the Signifier itself is spatially discrete, durably inscribed, and flat. (Hayles 1999,p.26)

How does this experience change with electronic media? The relation between striking a key and producing text with a computer is very different from the relation achieved with a typewriter. Display brightness is unrelated to keystroke pressure, and striking a single key can effect massive changes in the entire text. The computer restores and heightens the sense of word as image-an image drawn in a medium as fluid and changeable as water.(Hayles 1999,p.26)

 Interacting wih electronic images rather than with a materially resistant text, I absorb through my fingers as well as my mind a model of signification in which no simple one-to-one correspondence exists between signifier and signified. (Hayles 1999,p.26)
