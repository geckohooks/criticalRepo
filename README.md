# critical_repo
This is the Critical Repository (Repo) for my research on *Point Clouds, Photogrammetry and Volumetric Regimes*. As Carol Grey and Julian Malins outline: 
>There are two distinct phases in developing an understanding of your proposed research area through a Contextual Review:
>1. Initial surveys, to establish the proposal’s rationale and viability, to provide some background information, and to help focus the proposal. From these searches a set of relevant references/sources can be compiled into a bibliography and/or a ‘store’ of non-textual source material.
>2. The use of these references/sources to develop a critical review of your research context, leading to the identificaton of your own particular research question and the development of a convincing argument. (2004, pp.53-54)

This repo will contain a file of **notes and quotes** for each of the bibliographic sources in my initial survey, as well as **documentation of non-text sources**, including description and analysis of these. 

Notes cover a wide variety of functions, including: explaining quotes, considering possible relevance to my research topic, signposting links with other practitioners or theorists, or even notes-to-self about how/where material could get used, other research required to understand issues better, potential examples, designs, artworks, software etc. that illustrate/problematise the source in question.

## Literature Reviews
A literature review is normally a chapter within a master's or PhD thesis that reviews all relevant literature on a given topic. That is, it’s only about mapping and analysing theory.

## Contextual Reviews
Similarly, a contextual review is also chapter within a master's or PhD thesis, but rather than simply look at textual sources (i.e. literature) it includes discussion of relevant artworks, games, apps, designs and other cultural forms. 

## Contextual Repository
The contextual repo is a (github) repository containing notes and quotes about all the source materials you might use to inform your final thesis/project.

### Step 1: Make a list of sources (A Bibliography)
This will include: books, book chapters, journal articles and so on. But it can also include other cultural artefacts like artworks, designs, technologies etc.
Whatever sources you use, should be referenced using the Harvard Style:

Hemment, D. (2006) ‘Locative Arts,’ *Leonardo,* Vol. 39, No. 4, pp. 348–355.
Kojima, H. (2019) *Death Stranding.* Kojima Productions.
McCall, J. (2020) ‘The Historical Problem Space Framework: Games as a Historical Medium,’ *Game Studies,* Vol.  20, No. 3. [Available online at http://gamestudies.org/2003/articles/mccall].

### Step 2: Create new files for each item in the list, or duplicate the bibliography and 
This is so that you can have one copy that remains purely made up of bibliographic data (names, titles, publishers, dates etc.); and the other 

### Step 3: Annotating textual sources
- Start with a bibliographic data (names, titles, publishers, dates etc.)
- Next a paragraph or two summarizing the source: what it is or says, why its useful, how it adds to the discourse/practice etc.
- Take Harvard Referenced quotes
- Write notes about them (see section on possible note content)

### Step 4: Annotating non-text sources
Not necessarily in this order!
- Start with a bibliographic data (names, titles, publishers or equivalent, dates etc.)
- Include images, video or other documentation of the source
- Describe and analyse non-text sources (see section on possible note content)

### Possible Notes Content: 
- explanation, analysis or critique 
- discuss the relevance to your research interest, 
- consider how you might use the source, 
- compare/contract with other texts, practices and perspectives, 
- offer potential examples
- something else

### Using Markdown
>Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.

>Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.

>For example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., \*\*this text would usually be bold\*\* if I hadn't used backslashes to demonstrate). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications.

### Text example
**Jenkins, H. (2006) *Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide.* New York University Press**
Convergence Culture is about how digital information has brought together multiple media into one format, so that images, texts, video, sound, interaction and games all operate within the same space. In particular, Jenkins is interested in how the interactive nature of digital technology allows for participation in culture—he cites examples of fan-fiction ending up being used in TV and film, but also issues where remix practices problematize copyright and authorship, and intellectual property. 

>Welcome to convergence culture, where old and new media collide, where grassroots and corporate media intersect, where the power of the media producer and the power of the media consumer interact in unpredictable ways. (Jenkins 2006, p.2)

What’s interesting here is the implosion of meaning (ie. Burt & Bin Laden) and the levelling on the consumer / producer divide that convergence culture encourages. Here it seems important to be clear about who the consumers and producers are – as Jenkins points out this is a levelling of power structures between big corporate structures and bedroom hobbyists.

It's clear that a key element of Jenkins’ argument is concerned with participatory culture. I wonder if this should  become another key element of my research. Participatory, Open, FLOSS, Open-source... It would tie together  Umberto Eco, the implications of the Frankfurt School / themes from the Data Browser books, Henry Jenkins and  Bolter & Grusin…

>Not all participants are created equal. Corporations - and even individuals within corporate media - still exert  greater power than any individual consumer or even the aggregate of consumers. And some consumers have  greater abilities to participate in this emerging culture than others. (Jenkins 2006, p.3)

Could use this quote in a section about power structures embedded within media technologies and what they allow people to do, and who  has access to such technologies – something Jenkins seems to often forget.

>Convergence does not occur through media appliances, however sophisticated they become. Convergence occurs  within the brains of the individual consumers and through their social interactions with others. Each of us constructs  our own personal mythology from bits and fragments of information extracted from the media flow and  transformed into resources through which we make sense of our everyday lives. (Jenkins 2006, pp.3-4)

### Non-text example
**Ubisoft (2018) *Assassin's Creed - Odyssey. Discovery Tour: Ancient Greece.* Ubisoft**

![Assassin's Creed - Odyssey.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geckohooks/criticalRepo/main/assassinsCreed.jpeg)

>Discovery Tour: Ancient Greece is a chance to delve into the past and learn more about the conflicts, philosophy, myths, cities, art, and daily life of Ancient Greece. (Reparaz 2019) 

Think it might be interesting to use as an example of the relationship between gaming and cultural history. How does gamifying this history challenge its educational value? What’s the potential of this medium for changing classroom teaching?
