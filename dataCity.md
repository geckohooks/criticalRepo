# Gray, Jonathan and Marres, Noortje (2018) “The data city as public experiment.” In, *London Ideas,* No. 1, 13.07.2018, p. 11-15

This paper is about the role of data in understanding the city. Why are we looking at a paper that discusses data and the city, in a session on possible methods? Because ‘data’ (whether digital or not) is the raw material of research. Ways of collecting data, filtering it, analysing it etc. are central to research. Digital data is even more central to digital research! The methodological concerns in this paper are relevant to us; but so too are the issues they discuss. 

Professor Noortje Marres is Director of the Centre for Interdisciplinary Methodologies at the University of Warwick. She is currently a Visiting Professor in the Centre for Science and Technology Studies at the University of Leiden (the Netherlands). Her research is around Digital Sociology (she published a book on this topic 2017). 

Jonathan Gray is Senior Lecturer in Critical Infrastructure Studies at the Department of Digital Humanities, King's College London; Co-Founder of the Public Data Lab; and Research Associate at the Digital Methods Initiative at the University of Amsterdam and the médialab at Sciences Po, Paris.

>Cities have long been imagined as “machines for living,” and today's data technologies carry the promise of making them more “intelligent” … How might data, and data culture, play a role in reshaping city life, for whom, and to what end? (Gray & Noortje 2018, p.11)

>The life of a city may be understood from accounts and artefacts such as maps, music, fiction, films, plans, photographs, paintings, newspapers, conversations, reports, records, statues and street furniture. (Gray & Noortje 2018, p.11)

>Such items reflect certain aspects of urban life and leave others out: the schematic abstraction of tube maps highlights sequences of stops for transport users; monuments relate public spaces to historical events; photographs portray scenes in accordance with certain political or aesthetic visions. The significance of such things depends on who uses them and how. (Gray & Noortje 2018, p.11)

Are there artefacts that might help you understand your research? What are they? 
What do they reveal, and what do they leave out?

Gray & Noortje point out that cities collect data for many purposes--births, deaths, marriages, property ownership, crimes etc.--and have done for a long time. Moreover, they say, ‘Digital technologies multiply the sites where data is made, where it is made sense of and made actionable.’ (Gray & Noortje 2018, p.11)

Data from IoT devices, ‘often record activities and are not always tied to individuals; they are increasingly used to monitor, model, estimate, allocate, optimise, nudge, manage and display urban activities.’ (Gray & Noortje 2018, p.11)

Are there data streams and sources that might usefully inform your research? What are they? What do they reveal, and what do they leave out?

> today's data technologies provide apparently comprehensive insights into the particulars of urban living (Gray & Noortje 2018, p.12)

Is it true that ‘the visions and aesthetics associated with \[creating and using data\] can be sweeping, panoramic, sometimes even sublime.’? (12) What kind of problems might this lead to?

>...insofar as digital technologies make it possible to gather data pertaining to activities rather than named persons, they may have the potential to shift the focus from surveillance of individuals to creating new different kinds of data collectives. (Gray & Noortje 2018, p.12)

Presumably, when they use the term ‘data collectives’ they’re referring to various communities, shared interests or experiences, services etc. that particular data measure? For example, data about rubbish collection bring together the interests and experiences of everyone who live in a given area, whereas data about car parking mainly (but not entirely) affects car owners. That said, on a cursory google check, the term is also used to refer to users of data. For example, www.data-collective.org.uk defines the term: ‘The Data Collective is a community of individuals who work in the UK social sector, and use or want to use data.’ But in the context of the above quote, the gist is about the shift from surveilling individuals to being able to track the experiences of groups.

> Social media platforms such as Facebook amass data through what has been called the “double logic” of the platform – centralising data collection while distributing platform features through which data is collected. The self-declared contribution of such platforms is to enable us to live otherwise (to make new friends, visit new places); but they equally affect existing ways of doing, requiring new policies and public oversight. (Gray & Noortje 2018, p.12)

In what ways does this ‘double logic’ matter? How does it make a difference?

Gray & Noortje argue that while cities are capable of limiting multinationals (such as Uber) when they overstep civic interests, it’s much more difficult to develop ‘alternative, public-minded frameworks and methodologies for defning, designing and intervening in data.’
