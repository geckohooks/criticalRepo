# Snelting, Femke (2006) A Fish Can't Judge The Water.

Femke Snelting's text explores the 'unspectacular way our daily operations with software help to make sense of our environment.' (Snelting 2006)

>It has become our natural habitat. We practice software until we in-corporate its choreography. We make it disappear in the background. A seamless experience. We become one with our extensions. (Snelting 2006)

This phrasing is very reminiscent of Marshall McLuhan's concept of media found in his 1964 text *Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man* (sic). In that text, he argued that all media were extensions of our sensorium and  abilities so that, for example, the telephone extending our ability to speak at a distance, while the book extended cultural memory. Another aspect of this argument was that media also changed humans, culture and society. Similarly, Snelting argues that 'Software is never politically neutral, nor are its aesthetics without colour: each product prescribes use, and results in specific forms, sounds and shapes.' ( 2006) Key to her argument is whether we can 'use software to think' or conversely, whther 'the space within which making can take place is circumscribed' with each OS or software package? (Snelting 2006)

McLuhanite thinking has often been criticised as **technologically deterministic**, perhaps most famously by Raymond Williams who, as Lister et al suggest, argued that 'any idea that a medium can be reduced to a technology, or that the technological element which is admitted to be a part of any media process should be central to its study, [should be] strongly resisted.' (2009, p.78) As Lister et al continue: Williams, including his criticisms of McLuhan subsequently provided one of the 'master templates for what has become mainstream media studies.' How then, does Snelting follow such a perspective?

Although McLuhan was dismissed roundly by Williams and much of mainstream media theory, he has nevertheless found real favour amongst the likes of Baudrillard, Virilio, Poster, Kroker and others. Indeed, many of his ideas dovetailed so closely with developments in New Media, that WIRED magazine made him their Patron Saint. Snelting however, is clearly aware of both McLuhan's strengths and weaknesses. Her approach is closer to a materialist reading of technology through Freidrich Kittler.  

>Kittler proposes that any medium or channel of communication is a material technology, and thus cannot be understood in an interpretive sense. For example: how is it possible to understand a message once it is coded into a signal? What could a pulse of electricity or a string of binary digits possibly mean? In the light of such questions, Kittler takes McLuhan’s approach to be misguided, for while it might be possible to understand the effects media introduce into social relations, the idea of understanding media in themselves (as technologies) is out of the question. This is because meaning, for Kittler (1986: 166), is little more than an ‘anthropocentric illusion’ and, if anything, is not intrinsic or prior to technology but rather made possible and in turn structured by its development (as both Shannon and Weaver [1949] suggest): ‘the dominant information technologies of the day control all understanding and its illusions’ (Kittler, 1999: xl). Given this, Kittler seeks not to understand media but rather to document their emergence so as to make visible the structures of communication that technology both introduces and makes possible (what David Wellberry calls a ‘post-hermeneutic’ approach [1990: vii–xvi]). (Gane and Hansen-Magnusson 2006, pp.315-316)

Yet where Kittler distances himself from political and cultural discusion, Snelting uses the a materialist understanding of software to emphasise the political and ethical ramifications of technology. 

>Software is never politically neutral, nor are its aesthetics without colour: each product prescribes use, and results in specific forms, sounds and shapes. Software produces culture at the same time as it is produced by culture. It is shaped through and locked into economic models of production and distribution. (Snelting 2006)

Moreover, moving beyond technological determinism, her text frames technology in dynamic feedback loops with culture, politics and human action. So while there are McLuhanistic / Kittlerian flavours to her text, this is balanced by Williamsite perspectives too:

>Wherever we consider […] new media as subject to control and direction by human institutions, skill, creativity and intention, we are building upon such a Williamsite emphasis. (Lister et al 2009, p.78)

But she goes further too, by translating such perspectives into a personal praxis:'

>Could we understand what software does to our work and working patterns without being able to step away from it? What if our work is not only made with, but also through software? What if our work IS software? Can we think ourselves outside it?(Snelting 2006)

Halfway through the text there is a break, and Snelting changes direction: she moves to a discussion of Constant, the media group that she is part of.

>"someone can know how to type but not know how to read the words produced (...) just as someone can be able to read a typescript without knowing how to type" (Katherine Hayles - How We Became Posthuman) Because we want to be both typist and reader, Constant is committed to Open Source Software. Or more precisely: we are interested in the tension between those two positions.

Constant understand their development of Open Source Software as a political act. The typist and reader analogy implies both a materialist view (such as that of Kittler, or perhaps McLuhan), the Marxian understanding of politics and markets a la Williams, and the semiotic approaches of Baudrillard, Lyotard and others - even though, for Kittler, semiotics were irrelevant.

>Kittler’s approach also breaks with other well-known media theorists such as Baudrillard or Lyotard, for it pays little attention to either the shifting logic of simulacral forms or to the forces of the capitalist market. Instead, Kittler focuses overwhelmingly on the hardware of media technologies, and on the conditions and possibilities to which they give rise. (Gane and Hansen-Magnusson 2006, p.315)


**Cuttings**
>Like McLuhan, Kittler’s approach is deeply materialist in orientation and, above all, emphasizes the role of media technologies in structuring ‘human affairs’. But, at the same time, Kittler breaks from McLuhan in important ways. Not least, he proposes the impossibility of understanding media as technologies, for technologies are said to create the conditions under which understanding, or interpretive activity more generally, may take place, rather than vice versa. (Gane and Hansen-Magnusson 2006, p.315)

>What remains of people is what media can store and communicate. What counts are not the messages or the content with which they equip so-called souls for the duration of a technological era, but rather (and in strict accordance with McLuhan) their circuits, the very schematism of perceptibility. (Kittler 1999, pp.xl–xli) 

>Kittler and McLuhan here reach a basic agreement: media theory, or what Kittler calls media science (Medienwissenschaft), is not to centre on either the way communications technologies are used, or the content of the messages that pass through them, but rather on the basic material structures of the technologies themselves and the changes they introduce into culture. This marks two important departures from Shannon’s theory of information, for first, Kittler pays detailed attention to the physical components of communication (rather than assigning them a mathematical function), and, second, he analyses communication systems not simply in terms of their ability to process and transmit data but also in their capacity for storage. And with this emphasis on storage or memory, information is treated less as probability function (as it was for Shannon and Weaver) than as a material property (which in many cases is no longer distinct from the material components that hold or transmit it). (Gane and Hansen-Magnusson 2006, pp.316)
