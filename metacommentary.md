# Metacommentary and signposting

Meta means both 'referring to itself' and 'self referential', or 'transcending' and 'comprehensive'. In these terms, metacommentary is 'writing about writing' especially writing that refers to the methods and structures of the writing, or the argument (in this sense, transcending the particular points being made at that point).

Professor Pat Thompson says "metacommentary is the term used to describe a narrative which directs the reader’s attention to the text’s purpose and positioning."

One example of metacommentary is signposting. In the past, I've seen these terms as basically interchangable, but I now realise that while they're connected, they differ in emphasis. Signposting could be something like "as discussed in Section 1.3", or "as we will see in Chapter 3". But I think (and bear with me here) that metacommentary may encompass a wider range of meaning than this. For example, if you've been talking about R Murray Schafer previously, and later make a point about Max Neuhaus' work *Listen*, it would be metacommentary to say 'Neuhaus was working at the same time as Schafer'. Is this true? I think so - it ties the whole argument together.
