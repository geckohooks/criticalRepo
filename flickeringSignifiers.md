Hayles, N. Katharine (1999) "Virtual Bodies and Flickering Signifiers". In *How We Became Post Human - Virtual Bodies in Cybernetics, Literature and Informatics*. pp.25-49.

>In a literal sense, technologies of inscription are media when they are perceived as mediating, inserting themselves into the chain of textual production. (Hayles 1999,p.26)

>Kittler identifies the innovative characteristics of the typewriter, originally designed for the blind, not with speed but rather with "spatially designated and discrete signs," along with a corresponding shift from the word as flowing image to the word "as a geometrical figure created by the spatial arrangements of the letter keys" (here Kittler quotes Richard Herbertz).(Hayles 1999,p.26)

>Typewriter keys are directly proportionate to the script they produce. One keystroke yields one letter, and striking the key harder produces a darker letter. The system lends itself to a signification model that links signifier to signified in direct correspondence, for there is a one-to-one relation between the key and the letter it produces. Moreover, the Signifier itself is spatially discrete, durably inscribed, and flat. (Hayles 1999,p.26)

>How does this experience change with electronic media? The relation between striking a key and producing text with a computer is very different from the relation achieved with a typewriter. Display brightness is unrelated to keystroke pressure, and striking a single key can effect massive changes in the entire text. The computer restores and heightens the sense of word as image-an image drawn in a medium as fluid and changeable as water.(Hayles 1999,p.26)

>Interacting wih electronic images rather than with a materially resistant text, I absorb through my fingers as well as my mind a model of signification in which no simple one-to-one correspondence exists between signifier and signified. (Hayles 1999,p.26)
 
>The technologies of virtual reality, with their potential for full-body mediation, further illustrate the kind of phenomena that foreground pattern and randomness and make presence and absence seem irrelevant. Already an industry worth hundreds of millions of dollars, virtual reality puts the user's sensory system into a direct feedback loop with a computer. (Hayles 1999,p.26)

Why does she describe VR technologies in the plural? It's not only that there is more than one platform... (And in 1999 there were few if any commercial VR platforms anyway!)

>[Users of VR experience a] disorienting, exhilarating effect of the feeling that subjectivity is dispersed throughout the cybernetic circuit. In these systems, the user learns, kinesthetically and proprioceptively, that the relevant boundaries for interaction are defined less by the skin than by the feedback loops connecting body and simulation in a technobio-integrated circuit. (Hayles 1999,p.27)

Why does Hayles contrast absence/presence with pattern and randomness? What's the significance of this?

>Questions about presence and absence do not yield much leverage in this situation, for the avatar both is and is not present, just as the user both is and is not inside the screen. Instead, the focus shifts to questions about pattern and randomness. What transformations govern the connections between user and avatar? What parameters control the construction of the screen world? What patterns can the user discover through interaction with the system? Where do these patterns fade into randomness? What stimuli cannot be encoded within the system and therefore exist only as extraneous noise? When and how does this noise coalesce into pattern? (Hayles 1999,p.27)

>Sherry Turkle, in her fascinating work on people who spend serious time in MUDs, convincingly shows that virtual technologies, in a riptide of reverse influence, affect how real life is seen. "Reality is not my best window," one of her respondents remarks.(Hayles 1999,p.27)

I love this phrase 'a riptide of reverse influence'... really reminds me of Hito Steyerl's *Too Much World*.
