# critical_repo
This is the Critical Repository (Repo) for my research on *Point Clouds, Photogrammetry and Volumetric Regimes*. As Carol Grey and Julian Malins outline: 
>There are two distinct phases in developing an understanding of your proposed research area through a Contextual Review:
>1. Initial surveys, to establish the proposal’s rationale and viability, to provide some background information, and to help focus the proposal. From these searches a set of relevant references/sources can be compiled into a bibliography and/or a ‘store’ of non-textual source material.
>2. The use of these references/sources to develop a critical review of your research context, leading to the identificaton of your own particular research question and the development of a convincing argument. (2004, pp.53-54)

This repo will contain a file of notes and quotes for each of the bibliographic sources in my initial survey, as well as documentation of non-text sources, including description and analysis of these. 

Notes cover a wide variety of functions, including: explaining quotes, considering possible relevance to my research topic, signposting links with other practitioners or theorists, or even notes-to-self about how/where material could get used, other research required to understand issues better, potential examples, designs, artworks, software etc. that illustrate/problematise the source in question.
