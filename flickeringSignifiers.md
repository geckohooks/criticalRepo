Hayles, N. Katharine (1999) "Virtual Bodies and Flickering Signifiers". In *How We Became Post Human - Virtual Bodies in Cybernetics, Literature and Informatics*. pp.25-49.

The text can be thought of in a few sections. Hayles begins with the development of information theory, introducing the idea of information, pattern and randomness. She emphasises the distinction between information and the 'markers the embody it', such as newsprint or electromagnetic waves. And in the next couple of she follows this logic to show how electronic media differ from their mechanical counterparts, in the beautiful section about the correspondane between input/output in a typewriter, and the dislocation of i/o on a computer. From pages 27-29 she argues for the shift from absence/presence to pattern/randomness, and explores this in terms of examples like electronic money, genetic mutation, online communication and virtual reality. Importantly she emphasises the challenge to embodiment that this shift brings. However this is also why she uses the term 'informatics', since this implies the interrelations of technology, biology, culture, lanugage and society (29). By page 30 this preamble has allowed her to introduce the concept of the **flickering signifier.** From p.32-43 she explores a series of works of literature including: Thomas Pinchon's Gravity's Rainbow, Italo Calvino's If on a Winters Night a Traveller,  William Gibson's Neuromancer, Don DeLillo's White Noise, William Gibson's Naked Lunch; as well as the film, The Fly by David Cronenberg. Finally she finishes up 

>In a literal sense, technologies of inscription are media when they are perceived as mediating, inserting themselves into the chain of textual production. (Hayles 1999,p.26)

>Kittler identifies the innovative characteristics of the typewriter, originally designed for the blind, not with speed but rather with "spatially designated and discrete signs," along with a corresponding shift from the word as flowing image to the word "as a geometrical figure created by the spatial arrangements of the letter keys" (here Kittler quotes Richard Herbertz).(Hayles 1999,p.26)

>Typewriter keys are directly proportionate to the script they produce. One keystroke yields one letter, and striking the key harder produces a darker letter. The system lends itself to a signification model that links signifier to signified in direct correspondence, for there is a one-to-one relation between the key and the letter it produces. Moreover, the Signifier itself is spatially discrete, durably inscribed, and flat. (Hayles 1999,p.26)

>How does this experience change with electronic media? The relation between striking a key and producing text with a computer is very different from the relation achieved with a typewriter. Display brightness is unrelated to keystroke pressure, and striking a single key can effect massive changes in the entire text. The computer restores and heightens the sense of word as image-an image drawn in a medium as fluid and changeable as water.(Hayles 1999,p.26)

>Interacting wih electronic images rather than with a materially resistant text, I absorb through my fingers as well as my mind a model of signification in which no simple one-to-one correspondence exists between signifier and signified. (Hayles 1999,p.26)
 
>The technologies of virtual reality, with their potential for full-body mediation, further illustrate the kind of phenomena that foreground pattern and randomness and make presence and absence seem irrelevant. Already an industry worth hundreds of millions of dollars, virtual reality puts the user's sensory system into a direct feedback loop with a computer. (Hayles 1999,p.26)

Why does she describe VR technologies in the plural? It's not only that there is more than one platform... (And in 1999 there were few if any commercial VR platforms anyway!)

>[Users of VR experience a] disorienting, exhilarating effect of the feeling that subjectivity is dispersed throughout the cybernetic circuit. In these systems, the user learns, kinesthetically and proprioceptively, that the relevant boundaries for interaction are defined less by the skin than by the feedback loops connecting body and simulation in a technobio-integrated circuit. (Hayles 1999,p.27)

Why does Hayles contrast absence/presence with pattern and randomness? What's the significance of this?

>Questions about presence and absence do not yield much leverage in this situation, for the avatar both is and is not present, just as the user both is and is not inside the screen. Instead, the focus shifts to questions about pattern and randomness. What transformations govern the connections between user and avatar? What parameters control the construction of the screen world? What patterns can the user discover through interaction with the system? Where do these patterns fade into randomness? What stimuli cannot be encoded within the system and therefore exist only as extraneous noise? When and how does this noise coalesce into pattern? (Hayles 1999,p.27)

>Sherry Turkle, in her fascinating work on people who spend serious time in MUDs, convincingly shows that virtual technologies, in a riptide of reverse influence, affect how real life is seen. "Reality is not my best window," one of her respondents remarks.(Hayles 1999,p.27)

I love this phrase 'a riptide of reverse influence'... really reminds me of Hito Steyerl's *Too Much World*. 

>If the effects that the shift toward pattern/randomness has on literature are not widely recognized, perhaps it is because they are at once pervasive and elusive.(Hayles 1999,p.28)

This closely relates to Snelting's notion that 'the fish can't judge the water'.

>A book produced by typesetting may look very similar to one generated by a computerized program, but the technological processes involved in this transformation are not neutral. (Hayles 1999,p.28)

>Different technologies of text production suggest different models of signification; changes in signification are linked with shifts in consumption; shifting patterns of consumption initiate new experiences of embodiment; and embodied experience interacts with codes of representation to generate new kinds of textual worlds. (Hayles 1999,p.28)

>In fact, each category--production, signification, consumption, bodily experience, and representation--is in constant feedback and feedforward loops with the others. (Hayles 1999,p.28)

>As the emphasis shifts to pattern and randomness, characteristics of print texts that used to be transparent (because they were so pervasive) are becoming visible again through their differences from digital textuality. We lose the opportunity to understand the implications of these shifts if we mistake the dominance of pattern/randomness for the disappearance of the material world. In fact, it is precisely because material interfaces have changed that pattern and randomness can be perceived as dominant over presence and absence.(Hayles 1999,p.28)

>The pattern/randomness dialectic does not erase the material world; information in fact derives its efficacy from the material infrastructures it appears to obscure. This illusion of erasure should be the subject of inquiry, not a presupposition that inquiry takes for granted.(Hayles 1999,p.28) 

I seem to be quoting almost the whole of this chapter (so far) verbatim, because there's so much good stuff here. I particularly liked the idea that the informational logics of randomness and pattern don't get rid of materiality, but--even as they ascend in importance--help us understand the structures of materiality... And as the above emphasise, even information has a material aspect to it.

On p.29 Hayles discusses 'a parallel doubleness' of materiality between books and bodies. Why does she choose to compare these? Is it because she's trying to make the point that informational paradigm can be applied to genetics and literature? Or, like Bill Nichol's *The Work of Culture in the Age of Cybernetic Systems* that such paradigms end up determining the way we think about things. Maybe it's both: they are similar, and can be thought of in parallel; but both technologies, and the very thinking of them together, also tend to result in 'feedback and feedforward loops' i.e. a 'riptide of reverse influence'.  

>As we have seen, the human body is understood in molecular biology simultaneously as an expression of genetic information and as a physical structure. Similarly, the literary corpus is at once a physical object and a space of representation, a body and a message. Because they have bodies, books and humans have something to lose if they are regarded solely as informational patterns, namely the resistant materiality that has traditionally marked the durable inscription of books no less than it has marked our experiences ofliving as embodied creatures.(Hayles 1999,p.29)

Not sure on the exact framing of informatics here. Hayles says that informatics denote a network of relations. From Haraway, she suggests it includes: 'the technologies of information as well as the biological, social, linguistic, and cultural changes that initiate, accompany, and complicate their development'. (Hayles 1999,p.29) In sum then, it seems she understands informatics as the study of technologies networked relations with biological, social, cultural and other spheres. University of Edinburgh describes informatics as 'the study of the structure, behaviour, and interactions of natural [systems] and engineered computational systems.' (Hayles 1999,p.29) https://www.ed.ac.uk/files/atoms/files/what20is20informatics.pdf also see https://www.designinformatics.org/

**The main argument of this chapter is:**

>The contemporary pressure toward dematerialization, understood as an epistemic shift toward pattern/randomness and away from presence/absence, affects human and textual bodies on two levels at once, as a change in the body (the material substrate) and as a change in the message (the codes of representation). (Hayles 1999,p.29)

Quite a few artists, designers and theorists at the time understood digital tehnology as 'immaterial' or 'virtual'. This idea is still there in the name Virtual Reality, and implied in terms like 'cyberspace'.  

>The connectivity between these changes is, as they say in the computer industry, massively parallel and highly interdigitated. (Hayles 1999,p.29)

...that is, she's arguing that the material and informatic are closely entwined and interrelated, affecting one another in complex ways. Interdigitated means interlocking like fingers of clasped hands. Massively parallel 'is the term for using a large number of computer processors (or separate computers) to simultaneously perform a set of coordinated computations in parallel. The term first coined with the introduction of GPGPU \[General Purpose GPU\] by NVIDIA. GPUs are massively parallel architecture with tens of thosands of threads.

>My narrative will therefore weave back and forth between the represented worlds of contemporary fictions, models of signification implicit in word processing, embodied experience as it is constructed by interactions with information technologies, and the technologies themselves. (Hayles 1999,p.29)

i.e. between literature, semiotics, the embodied experience of such content as it's constructed by technology and the technology itself. Hayles is attacking 'massively parallel' topics, in order to trace the various feedback/forward loops between culture, society and computing. Reminds me somewhat of Manovich's concept -- in The Language of New Media (published a couple of years later in 2001) -- of cultural transcoding. For Manovich, transcoding is central to what computers do... taking a human layer and making it machine readable or vice versa, making computing layer readable by humans. In cultural transcoding, these two separate layers, the cultural and the computational are compounded together.

>Information technologies do more than change modes of text production, storage, and dissemination. They fundamentally alter the relation of Signified to Signifier. (Hayles 1999, pp.29-30)

>**Carrying the instabilities implicit in Lacanian floating signifiers one step further, information technologies create what I will call flickering signifiers, characterized by their tendency toward unexpected metamorphoses, attenuations, and dispersions.(Hayles 1999, p.30)**

What are 'floating signifiers'? Also known as an 'empty signifier', these are signifiers without a referent i.e. a symbol that points to no actual object and has no agreed upon meaning. Baudrillard argues that in Postmodernism, 'Signifier is displaced from the signified, denoting the absence (instead of the presence) of reality, which thus underscores absent center. Floating signifiers displaced from the signified become simulacra.' (Zeng 2012, p.39) . For Chandler a floating signifier is: '… a signifier with a vague, highly variable, unspecifiable or nonexistent signified. Such signifiers mean different things to different people: they may stand for many or even any signified; they may mean whatever their interpreters want them to mean. (Chandler, 2013: 52) Perhaps a country's flag is a good example of this: it may mean different things to different people, and even change in meaning over time. So floating signifiers are unstable, and change in meaning, but presumably Hayles is suggesting here that  a flickering signifier is unstable because it can be deleted, copied, pasted, scaled, reversed or otherwise filtered ad infinitum. There is no fixed meaning.

> When a text presents itself as a constantly refreshed image rather than as a durable inscription, transformations can occur that would be unthinkable if matter or energy, rather than informational patterns, formed the primary basis for the systemic exchanges. This textual fluidity, which users learn in their bodies as they interact with the system, implies that signifiers flicker rather than float. (Hayles 1999, p.30)

> In informatics, the signifier can no longer be understood as a single marker, for example an ink mark on a page. Rather it exists as a flexible chain of markers bound together by the arbitrary relations specified by the relevant codes (Hayles 1999, p.31)

> Intervening between what I see and what the computer reads are the machine code that correlates alphanumeric symbols with binary digits, the compiler language that correlates these symbols with higher-level instmctions determining how the symbols are to be manipulated, the processing program that mediates between these instmctions and the commands I give the computer, and so forth. A signifier on one level becomes a signified on the next-higher level. (Hayles 1999, p.31)

> If I am producing ink marks by manipulating movable type, changing the font requires changing each line of type. By contrast, if I am producing **flickering signifiers** on a video screen, changing the font is as easy as giving the system a single command. The longer the chain of codes, the more radical the transformations that can be effected. Acting as linguistic transducers, the coding chains impart astonishing power to even very small changes. Such amplification is possible because the constant reproduced through multiple coding layers is a pattern rather than a presence.

This, it seems to me, is at the heart of what digital information is, and how/why it matters. This concept of a 'linguistic transducer' is amazing...! The power to extend, amplify, modulate meaning through code.

> Although mutation disrupts pattern, it also presupposes a morphological standard against which it can be measured and understood as a mutation. If there were only randomness, as with the random movements of gas molecules, it would make no sense to speak of mutation. We have seen that in electronic textuality, the possibilities for mutation within the text are enhanced and heightened by long coding chains. We can now understand mutation in more fundamental terms.(Hayles 1999, p.33)

That is to say, mutation is a modulation of existing pattern, not pure randomness.

> Mutation is crucial because it names the bifurcation point at which the interplay between pattern and randomness causes the system to evolve in a new direction. It reveals the productive potential of randomness that is also recognized within information theory when uncertainty is seen as both antagonistic and intrinsic to information. (Hayles 1999, p.33)

So why does she continue to push this comparison between the bodily/biological/genetic and the informational? It seems that she's not simply following Bill Nichol's approach of saying that because cybernetics is the dominant paradigm, that's how we're going to understand the world. Rather, she's arguing the case to say they really do share strong parallels. And in this example, she makes the case well: the notion that uncertainty is intrinsic AND antagonistic to information compares beautifully with the idea of genetic mutation.

There's a section where Hayles discussion Lacan, Freud and castration; but really the mention of these is emphasise the importance of moving away from their logics, to one of mutation. She discusses David Cronenburg's The Fly, when Jeff Goldbloom mutates from human to -- I guess -- a posthuman, through the advances of science and technology. 

> the posthuman appears when computation rather than possessive individualism is taken as the ground of being, a move that allows the posthuman to be seamlessly articulated with intelligent machines.(Hayles 1999, p.34)

> "Employment of tools appears to be \[mans\] chief bioogical characteristic, for considered functionally they are detachable extensions of the forelimb." (Oakley 1949, in Hayles 1999, p.34)

> By the 1960s, Marshall McLuhan was speculating about the transformation that media, understood as technological prostheses, were effecting on human beings. (Hayles 1999, p.34)

> \[McLuhan\] argued that humans react to stress in their enviroments by withdrawing the locus of selfhood inward, in a numbing withdrawal from the world he called \[...\] "autoamputation." This withdrawal in turn facilitates and requries compensating technological extensions that project the body-as-prosthesis back out into the world \[...\] McLuhan clearly sees electronic media are capable of bringing about a reconfiguration so extensive as to change the nature of "man." (Hayles 1999, p.34)

> A shift from ownership to access is another manifestation of the underlying transition from presence/absence to pattern/randomness \[...\] A significant difference between information and durable goods is replicability. Information is not a conserved quantity. If I give you information, you have it and I do too. With information, the constraining factor between the haves and have-nots is not so much possession as access. (Hayles 1999, p.39)

Hayles mentions that David Harvey talks about information society moving from a Fordist regime to one of flexible accumulation. Fordism being to do with mass production and mass consumption. In The Condition of Postmodernity, Harvey describes flexible accumulation as: 

> marked by a direct confrontation with the rigidities of Fordism.  It rests on flexibility with respect to labour processes, labour markets, products, and patterns of consumption.  It is characterized by the emergence of entirely new sectors of production, new ways of providing financial services, new markets, and, above all, greatly intensified rates of commercial, technological, and organizational innovation.  It has entrained rapid shifts in the patterning of uneven development, both between sectors and between geographical regions, giving rise, for example, to a vast surge in so-called 'service-sector' employment as well as to entirely new industrial ensembles in hitherto underdeveloped regions \[...\]  Has also also entailed a new round of what I shall call 'time-space compression'. . . in the capitalist world -- the time horizons of both private and public decision-making have shrunk, while satellite communication and declining transport costs have made it increasingly possible to spread those decisions immediately over an ever wider and variegated space (Harvey 1989,p.147).
