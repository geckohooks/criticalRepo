# critical_repo
This is the Critical Repository (Repo) for my research on *Point Clouds, Photogrammetry and Volumetric Regimes*. As Carol Grey and Julian Malins outline: 
>There are two distinct phases in developing an understanding of your proposed research area through a Contextual Review:
>1. Initial surveys, to establish the proposal’s rationale and viability, to provide some background information, and to help focus the proposal. From these searches a set of relevant references/sources can be compiled into a bibliography and/or a ‘store’ of non-textual source material.
>2. The use of these references/sources to develop a critical review of your research context, leading to the identificaton of your own particular research question and the development of a convincing argument. (2004, pp.53-54)

This repo will contain a file of **notes and quotes** for each of the bibliographic sources in my initial survey, as well as **documentation of non-text sources**, including description and analysis of these. 

Notes cover a wide variety of functions, including: explaining quotes, considering possible relevance to my research topic, signposting links with other practitioners or theorists, or even notes-to-self about how/where material could get used, other research required to understand issues better, potential examples, designs, artworks, software etc. that illustrate/problematise the source in question.

## Literature Reviews
A literature review is normally a chapter within a master's or PhD thesis that reviews all relevant literature on a given topic. That is, it’s only about mapping and analysing theory.

## Contextual Reviews
Similarly, a contextual review is also chapter within a master's or PhD thesis, but rather than simply look at textual sources (i.e. literature) it includes discussion of relevant artworks, games, apps, designs and other cultural forms. 

## Contextual Repository
The contextual repo is a (github) repository containing notes and quotes about all the source materials you might use to inform your final thesis/project.

### Step 1: Make a list of sources (A Bibliography)
This will include: books, book chapters, journal articles and so on. But it can also include other cultural artefacts like artworks, designs, technologies etc.
Whatever sources you use, should be referenced using the Harvard Style:

Hemment, D. (2006) ‘Locative Arts,’ *Leonardo,* Vol. 39, No. 4, pp. 348–355.
Kojima, H. (2019) *Death Stranding.* Kojima Productions.
McCall, J. (2020) ‘The Historical Problem Space Framework: Games as a Historical Medium,’ *Game Studies,* Vol.  20, No. 3. [Available online at http://gamestudies.org/2003/articles/mccall].

### Step 2: Create new files for each item in the list, or duplicate the bibliography and 
This is so that you can have one copy that remains purely made up of bibliographic data (names, titles, publishers, dates etc.); and the other 

### Step 3: Annotate each source
- Start with a bibliographic data (names, titles, publishers, dates etc.)
- Next a paragraph or two summarizing the source: what it is or says, why its useful, how it adds to the discourse/practice etc.
- Take quotes from text sources (these should be Harvard Referenced) & write notes about them (see below)
- Describe and analyse non-text sources

Notes may: 
- explain quotes, 
- analyse sources/quotes, 
- discuss the relevance to your research interest, 
- consider how you might use the source, 
- compare/contract with other texts, practices and perspectives, 
- offer potential examples
- something else

### Using Markdown
"Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.

Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.

For example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., \*\*this text would usually be bold\*\* if I hadn't used backslashes to demonstrate). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications."
